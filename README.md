# NIRS-cluster-calibration
An R-workflow utilizing the plantspec package to perform parallel calibrations of NIRS models for leaf traits on a computing cluster

This workflow was developed for the EVE - High-Performance Computing Cluster of the Helmholtz-Zentrum f√ºr Umweltforschung GmbH - UFZ (https://wiki.ufz.de/eve/). As of now only .asd files are supported. A basic familiarity with server computing tools is assumed. 

## Requirements:
R Version 4.0 or higher

A HPC cluster running SLURM

Access to the HPC cluster command line (e.g. via PuTTY)

Access to the HPC Cluster workspace (e.g. via Filezilla)

Several R packages, especially plantspec (https://github.com/griffithdan/plantspec), asdreader (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/asdreader/) and Hmisc (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Hmisc/), but see the R scripts for a complete list. 

A toolchain built for R (e.g. via Easybuild). 

## Data preparation
In this step the dataset will be prepared for calibration on a local PC. Input files consist of one folder containing NIRS Spectra and two datatables, *samples.csv* and and *traits.csv*. The *prep_cluster.R* will take this data, process it and output a handy *prep_workspace.rda* file to upload to the server. 

## Cluster preparation
Here we set up our cluster pipeline, consisting of an *array_job_wrapper.sh*, which starts a number of *submit.sh* scripts, with each one starting a job running the *SPECTROSCOPY_v_6_3.R* script. Once the submit scripts are finished, the *array_job_wrapper.sh* launches *submit_merge_output.sh* which starts a job running the *merge_output.R*. This script pulls the results from each single calibration instance and feeds them into the merger script, which finally writes the results as a handy *finalmatrix.rds* file to be downloaded back to the local PC. 

The core is the *SPECTROSCOPY_v_6_3.R* script. Each instance of this script runs a calibration with randomized spectral regions, with the region set resulting in the best model passed on.

## Cluster calculation
Send the job off to the great processor in the sky and monitor it

To initiate the process we put 

*bash -x array_job_wrapper.sh /home/user/Spectra_for_Calibration 25*

into the bash command line. 

We can check the status of our job by putting *squeue* into the bash command line. 

## Data analysis
Download the *finalmatrix.rds* to the local PC. *results_cluster.R* will run an analysis and present a table with the 10 best models created during the calibration process.
